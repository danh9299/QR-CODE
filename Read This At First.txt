Please read this note before viewing my source code

The code will not work if you do not install the environment on your computer (terminal)

1. You will need to create a folder, in which you store the Python file.
2. Open cmd.exe (windows + R, type "cmd", and tap on OK)
3. As the cmd.exe pops up, you type the following command: cd [the link to your folder you create at 1. step]
4. Succesfully, we continue to type the next command: py -m pip install qrcode
5. If the command works, continue to type the next command: py -m pip install pillow

If everything works well, open the code and runs it!
